# 🎓 Engineering Student Day Predictor

> *"Will I survive 3rd year? Asking for a friend."*

A cyberpunk-themed web app that predicts what day tomorrow will be with 42% accuracy (the engineering answer). Built as a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the struggles of third-year engineering students everywhere.

## ✨ Features

- **Retro-futuristic UI**: Neon colors, animated grid background, and CRT scanlines for that authentic hacker aesthetic
- **Highly Advanced Algorithm**: Uses cutting-edge technology to calculate tomorrow's day with unprecedented accuracy
- **Engineering Humor**: Loading messages that every engineering student can relate to
- **Confetti Celebration**: Because surviving another day deserves recognition
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile (for checking between lectures)

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Select what day it is today (because who can remember?)
2. Click "PREDICT TOMORROW"
3. Watch as the system analyzes your survival probability
4. Receive your prediction along with appropriately snarky commentary

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks were harmed)
- Canvas Confetti for celebrations
- Retro terminal aesthetics with CSS animations
- Responsive design principles

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. No installation, no npm packages, no build process. Just like engineering problems should be (but never are).

```bash
# Clone or download the file
# Open index.html in your browser
# That's it!
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The app features:
- **Neon cyan and orange** color scheme for maximum cyberpunk vibes
- **Animated grid background** that moves like you're flying through cyberspace
- **Terminal-style interface** because real engineers use the command line
- **Loading messages** featuring relatable engineering struggles:
  - Control systems confusion
  - Laplace transform nightmares
  - 7 AM EM Fields class trauma
  - Maxwell's equations haunting

## 🤓 Easter Eggs

- Different day colors for each prediction
- Random confidence messages that change each time
- Idle animations when you're not clicking
- Engineering-specific terminology sprinkled throughout

## 📝 Day-Specific Commentary

Each day comes with its own brand of sarcasm:
- **Monday**: Condolences and 7 AM class warnings
- **Tuesday**: Control systems lab survival tips
- **Wednesday**: Hump day encouragement
- **Thursday**: Weekend is almost here (almost)
- **Friday**: Victory... unless you have Saturday lab
- **Saturday**: Time to sleep through lectures
- **Sunday**: The calm before the storm

## 🎯 Accuracy Disclaimer

This predictor has been scientifically proven to be:
- More accurate than your 7 AM attendance record
- More reliable than your alarm clock
- Higher confidence than most engineering students' GPAs
- Exactly 42% certain (the answer to everything)

*Remember: The real treasure wasn't the days we predicted along the way, but the friends we made in the 7 AM lectures we barely survived together.* ☕⚙️📚
